\# kirssqm is a python package for qubit measurement and related useful libraries.  
\# Below I outline things that I'd like to include in the package

# General rules for design 
- Design for interface.
- How to configure experiments
- Make it modular
- Make it easy for scripting
- Make it easy to extend
- Obey SOLID principle as much as possible
    - Single responsibility principle
    - Open-closed principle: open for  extension, close for modification
    - Liskov substitution principle
    - Interface segregation principle
    - Dependency inversion principle
 - Obey PEP8
 - Make a good documentation
 
# krissqm: kriss quantum measurement package 
- Channels
- File handler
- Pulse sequencer
- Sweeper
- Instrument
- Plotter
- Utility (load_data, plotting, ...)
- Analysis
    - Fittings
        - T1, Ramsey, DragFit, CRFit, ...
        - Resonator fit, ...
        - QST, QPT, RB ... fits
        - HamiltonianTomoFit
 - library: library of experiments for calibration, characterization and verification. Sort of list of standard toolkit, something that can be used routinely.
    - Calibration
        - RamseyCal
        - RabiAmpCal
        - DragCal
        - Pi2Cal
        - PiCal
        - CRAmpCal
        - CRPhaseCal
        - CRLengthCal
        - siZZle
        - CR tomo to cancel classical crosstalk
        - direct CR cal?

    - Characterization
        - Spectroscopy
        - T1, Ramsey, Echo
        - Readout assignment fidelity
        - QP parity
        - Effective temperature meas
    
    - Verification: tomography, benchmarking, ... for measuring gate fidelity, quantum circuit fidelity, and etc.
        - QST
        - QPT
        - GST
        - RB
        - Leakage RB
        - Purity RB
        - Cycle benchmarking (CB)
        - Cross entropy benchmarking (XEB)    
        - QV (Quantum Volume)
